[Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) is the next generation hypervisor technology. It has many incredible powerful features, among which **lightweight size**, **fast boot-up time**, and **isolation from host**, are the main reasons for me to utilize it docker in my personal Ubuntu server.

As the diagram depicts below, I have set up 4 microservices using docker in one Linxu server.
0. prerequisite: [DynamicDNS using ddclient]()
1. [OpenVPN Server]()
2. [Nginx Reverse Proxy]()
3. [Personal Jekyll Blog]()
4. My own website (coming soon)
