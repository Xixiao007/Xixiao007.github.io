# Clean Code

As Robert C. Martin stated in his book Clean Code, "Clean code is code that has been taken care of. Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and orderly. They have paid appropriate attention to details. They have cared."

As a clean code concept lover, I initiated a meetup community in Helsinki to learn and share this topic. By doing this, I have pushed myself to learn deeper as well as met programmers with the same passion.

Below is a presentation from the community about naming. Enjoy!
