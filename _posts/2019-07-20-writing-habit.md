I recently started to realize that writing is the most essential skill for career and business and everything, period.

English is not my native language, I always struggle to put words in the right order, my vocaburary is limited, my grammar is bad. So many execuses to stop me from practicing the writing skills.

Actually I am improving podcast hosting skills, I am improving youtube video skills, video editing skills, but not writing, not at all.

I finally, yesterday, made my 2-year goals, a side hustle, a big goal for me. They are:

- one podcast episode per week
- one youtube video per week
- one Salesforce blog
- one blog thread here per day (to cultivate the writing habit)

Why do I think writing is the most essential skill? Because nowadays the internet indexes heavily text files. People use text to communicate. Many famous people also told me so.

It would be so difficult to achieve above multiple goals. But I decide to laze focus on them 100%, 1000%.

What have I done? I stopped hosting the local clean code meetup, which I love and made a lot of great friends. I stopped investing time to learn details of crypto. I stopped actively learning other programming languages. I will now only focus on those 4 points.

What are challenging points? These are what I can think of in addition to persistency:

- how to get podcast guests for weekly schedule? I need to spend a lot of time and constantly seek for new high quality guests
- select topics for youtube videos
- select topics for salesforce blogging

Btw, this also means my spare time schedule changes. A lot of entertaining time, which was already much less comparing to before, will be cut off.

Nevertheless, these are the compensations I agreed with myself, so I will stick to my decision and do the side hustling for 2 years!
