# Flowers for Algernon

[Flowers for Algernon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowers_for_Algernon) is a science fiction short story written by [Daniel Keyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Keyes) in year 1958.

This book was recommended by an online book reading website in China. Frankly speaking, I had little idea what this book was all about  and didn't have high expectation from a book written six decades ago.

I spent 3-day spare time to finish it, the Chinese translated version, and I was really moved by the plot and the language Daniel used to write the story.
Then I finished the original English version, and its audio book as well, in a row.

I don't know how to express my feeling of reading this book without spoiling the plot. I can only say that I had all tears in my faces by reading it to the end.

it is a book I highly recommend to everybody!
