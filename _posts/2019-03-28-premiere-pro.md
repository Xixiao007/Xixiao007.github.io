# Video Editing Tool

In order to produce high quality video content, there are people spending entire life to sharpen their skills on both shooting and editing.

I am an amateur who  use phone to take shots to produce education content and is fond of video editing. I started several months ago to learn adobe Premiere Pro and After Effect.

The journey is with so much fun. The learned stuff enables me to produce different styles or themes of content.

Here below is one short clip that I created after my middle schoole classmates re-union party, which brought back so much joyful forgotten memories.
