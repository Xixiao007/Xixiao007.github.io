In yesterday's blog thread, I specified the 4 goals for the upcoming one year. One of the goals is to create a youtube channel and post one video per week.

I spent some time to think about what content to put out and also did some search in youtube around Salesforce developer related channel. After my research, I realize that this is a blue ocean, meaning not many big fishes existing yet.

At this moment, I consider this is what type of content I plan to create:

## Short time period

3 - 5mins videos might be a good start. This should be good length for starters. For one reason, it is easier to shoot and edit, for another, it is easier for audiences to consume -- by given that the content is engaging.

## High quality content

At the beginning, it will definitely take time for me to trial and error. But I have the confidence to create relatively engaging content. In addition, my Premiere Pro editing skills are a plus.

Put myself into audience's shoes, a Salesforce developer video topic longer than 10mins drastically reduce my interests as my brain won't be able to consume and digest that much technical content.

## Good topics

I have an idea list to write down good ideas popping up in my head. I will start with instruction and setup type of videos, as they are for beginners and will attract more audiences. Obviously, beginners are far more than advanced developers.

## Learn Youtube SEO

This is a big rabbit hole, but good news is that so many free and high quality content is free in the internet. In addition, if I put a bit more attention to youtube and google search SEO, I am already 50% better than most of amature youtubers.

Also, I found it intriguing to learn SEO skills. I always love to play and polish tooling skills from both gaming and programming fields.

## Audience commenting

I dont have a sophisticated idea on this. But I know how important it is to engage audiences and let them voice out. The more I let audience talk and create content they need, the more attraction the channel gains.

## Video talking skills

This is something I am not very good at (yet). English is not my native, I still found it is difficult to talk in a clear manner and express myself well.

And talk to the camera is something I also need to learn. But hey, this is exactly why I wanna achieve this goal, right? It is all about practicing, practicing, practicing until I master it.

Can't wait to see my first youtube videos on my Salesforce Way channel!
