# IntelliJ and Illuminated Cloud

I have used Vim, Emacs and Visual Studio. For Salesforce development, I am an active user of VSCode. Many developers are fond of using IntelliJ + Illuminated Cloud, I assume there must be some cool features that make them addicting, which I may never experience in VSCode.

In addition, I had a chat with the author of Illuminated Cloud, Scott Wells, in my little [podcast](http://salesforceway.com). I enjoyed the conversation and admired how he dedicated his time on continously polishing this tool.

Therefore, I decided to give the combination of IntelliJ Idea and Illuminated Cloud a try. After all, I have learned Vim and Emacs the hard way, learning one more modern IDE should be over difficult, should it?

One of the biggest hurdles to get accustomed to using IntelliJ is its numerous seemingly badly-designed shortkeys, especially the shortkeys involving functional keys (f1, f2, etc.). I assume no modern editor should use those keys--just my 5cent humble opinion.

Nevertheless, I decide to give it a try for one month or two and see how I like it.

# Often used shortkeys

Here is the list of keys I am learning:

| Auto-indent line(s) | Ctrl + Alt + I | Cmd + Opt + I |
| Reformat code | Ctrl + Alt + L | Cmd + Opt +  L|
