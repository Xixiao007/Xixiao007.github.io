I have used Vim, Emacs and Visual Studio. For Salesforce development, I am an active user of VSCode. But I wanna give IntelliJ Idea + Illuminated Cloud a try. Reasons:

1. Many developers are fond of using IntelliJ + Illuminated Cloud, I assume there must be some cool features that make them addicting, which I may never experience in VSCode.

2. I had a chat with the author of Illuminated Cloud, Scott Wells, in my little [podcast](http://salesforceway.com). I enjoyed the conversation and admired how he dedicated his time on continuously polishing this tool.

3. IntelliJ has a `IdeaVim` which simulates Vim. I figured out most of vim keys can be seamlessly used in IntelliJ, which shortens drastically my hotkey learning curve.

Therefore, I decided to give the combination of IntelliJ Idea and Illuminated Cloud a try for one month or two and see how it goes. After all, I have learned Vim and Emacs the hard way, learning one more modern IDE shouldn't be overly difficult, isn't it?
