# Clojure

I have wanted to learn Clojure language for a long time, because: 

1. I have used emacs for a long while and lisp isn't an alien to me.
2. I want to be amred with proper understanding over functional programming.

Recently, I started to read the book - living clojure, and begin to perceive the beauty of functional programming.
The recursion, the modifiers for collections, the immutable data structure and more upcoming chapters in the book... These opened a new world for me.

I might never become a professional Clojure programmer, but learing it gives me so much fun :)!
