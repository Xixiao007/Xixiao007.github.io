In my [previous thread]({% post_url 2017-12-10-salesforce-dx-intro %}), we have briefly introduced both features and challenges on Salesforce Development Experience---SFDX. If you are brand new to SFDX, I'd strongly recommend you check that thread first. Once you’re done with that, you’re ready to get started!

After playing around with SFDX for weeks, I have come up with this idea to collect most frequently used SFDX commands into a cheat sheet.

I will keep updating this sheet in the future. Hopefully it is also a handy reference for you guys!
