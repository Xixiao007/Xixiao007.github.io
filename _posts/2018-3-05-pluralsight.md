# What is Pluralsight?

<img src="http://www.salesforceway.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pluralsight-logo_w_500.jpg" alt="Pluralsight" width="500" height="375" class="size-full wp-image-230" />

One of excellent ways to learn IT stuff is to follow along coaching videos recorded by subject experts.

After spending some time to google around and comparing between couple of online IT training video websites, I decided to purchase annual subscription of [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/).

That was 4 years ago. Since then, I have been a continuous subscriber and never regretted its cost.

I have seen Pluralsight grown from a simple inventory of IT coaching videos to a trusted IT coaching service provider with massively diversified knowledge content. And many people working in IT had recommended it highly.

# What I have learned

It is literally too many to list down here. 

Some examples: Javascript, Typescript, Continous Integration, DevOps, MachineLearning, C#, Testing automation, TDD, Jenkins, Visual Studio Code, <a href="http://www.salesforceway.com/2017/12/sfdx-intro/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Salesforce DX</a>, <a href="http://www.salesforceway.com/2018/01/prototyping-salesforce-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Salesforce Lighting Component</a>, SharePoint, SQL, No-SQL, Career planning...

Nowadays, Pluralsight has an amazing long list of [learning paths/topics](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths) to choose from. Check it out, there gotta be something you want to learn, right!?

Not a big surprise that Salesforce courses appear in Pluralsight too.

Here is the [search result](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/search?q=salesforce) by using "Salesforce" keyword. As of today, 35 courses avaiable already!
