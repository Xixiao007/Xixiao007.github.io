The 4 goals I defined for the upcoming year is overwhelming.
Sometimes, I feel motivated very much. Sometimes, I fear, feel it is imppossible to keep up for one full year.

Can I cut them into half? Frankly, half is a fairly good result too, isn't it? Each time I have similar thoughts like this, I fight with myself.

There are so many things along the journey that I will discover and learn. It is very exciting, and intimitating too.
