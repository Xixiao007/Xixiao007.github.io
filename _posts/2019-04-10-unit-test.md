# Testing on lightning platform

Testing is a fascinating topic for Salesforce developers. For one obvious reason, the platform demands 75% code coverage testing. For another, Writing good testing reflects the developer's coding experience and the flexibility of OO design.

I just wanna highlight several iportant points of Apex testing, so I can come back to review them when I forget :).

1. `System.StubProvider` is a powerful stubbing method. I (you too) should learn and use it in my testing.
2. DML is usually unnecessary. Ask myself questions:
   - Am I testing any DML related code (Triggers, Process Builders, etc.)?
   - Do I have any need to insert these records?
   - Can my code be written to have these records retrieved via a mockable method?

3. Record in memory allows to set a bogus Id.
4. `Test visible` for variable and method. Use it well to make magic, refer to Dan Appleman's `Advanced Apex Programming` book.
