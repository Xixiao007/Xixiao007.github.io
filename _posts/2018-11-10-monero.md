# Monero - privacy features

Monero is a secure, private, untraceable and fungible cryptocurrency. It cares users' privacy to an very extrme.

From technology point of view, its privacy implmenetation is facinating, such as stealth address, ring signature, I2P, and so on.

However, most of study resources out there in the internet are either too shallow (i.e. marketing words only) or too much into the rabit hole of mathmatic formal prove, which drives 99% of people's eyes going blur.

I spent sometime to study Monero and made a presentation out of it. The goal of my presenting content is to explain these mysterious principles to ordinary people who are just like me, yet still unveal "how is it done" with as little as possible math equations.
