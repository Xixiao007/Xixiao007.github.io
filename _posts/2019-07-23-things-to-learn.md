Since I have defined my one-year goal previously, now I am taking steps to tackle challenges along the one year journey.
I have a note list to write down things coming to my mind that needs to be learned to prepare for my goals.

This list grows larger and larger, items with sub items, sub items with sub-sub items. I am already slightly overwhelmed without finishing one Salesforce blog or Salesforce YouTube video.

## Equipment

In addition, I also studied what gears are needed for shooting YouTube videos. The typical set of gears, in order to shoot good quality videos, include camera, external microphone, lens, tri-pod. Price is around 1000 euros all included. Not too much if these gears can facilitate me to reach my goal, but I decided to hold the horse and start with iPhone and a lav microphone.

There is a difference between "things I want" and "things I need". Above gear set is "things I want" while there is really not compulsory to have them in order to make YouTube videos with good content. In addition, the journey of reaching the goal has a lot of fun, instead of the time when the goal is accomplished.

## Shooting skills

It requires absolute a lot of practice to become comfortable in front of camera. How to talk with a machine as if you are talking with a person face-to-face, how to speak naturally rather than mono tone, how to use body gestures, moving hands, and so on and so on. I am sure once I start to shoot videos, I will encounter many more new issues. It is not an easy job, not at all. Also it has nothing to do with programming :D.

However, this is the fun part. Why has it to be related to programming, it is just a hobby, a hobby with goals I set for myself.

## topics

Speaking of the podcast, I am much more actively inviting guests into my podcast, because I need to release at least 2 interview episodes in the podcast. The other two episodes can be my "solo friday" session, where I ramble on a topic by myself. Ideally, it would be 3 interview sessions + 1 solo friday in each month.

For youTube channel, I decide to start with DX, Git, Scratch org, VSCode, these topics that are most relevant to Salesforce developers. I am gonna demonstrate how I understand on these topics and what are the setups and entire process of using these tools. Some of them are basics, some of them are knowledge sharing. I plan to prepare 8 videos into the "video buffer" so I won't miss the one-video-per-week goal under pressing situation.

In terms of Salesforce blog, I decided to create repurposed content, i.e. the same content as in Youtube. I learned that people have different ways of learning. Some like videos, some like blog text. So it is a better strategy if I can both content and link them one with another. This will be also good for google search indexing.

## Biggest challenges

In my opinion, there are two biggest challenges:

1. creating good quality YouTube Videos. Because there are so much to do in order to make a good video, I do need to focus on the ones that is beneficial for audiences, meaning "low hanging fruit".

2. invite enough guests into my podcast. Salesforce is a relatively small eco-system. There are not many channels and active developers. I do need constantly (daily) to scan news, blogs and tweeter to get new potential guests, reach them out, and hopefully convince them to join me for a topic. It is very time consuming, but once guest accepts my request, it is a new topic for me to learn :).

That's it for today. See you tomorrow!
